# hash-tag
search hash tag in given text
Hashtags is a way to connect social media content to a specific topic, event, theme or conversation. 
I have developed a small code which will extract hash tagged words(#fun) from the given string and save the hash tags.
If the user forgets to add tag before the string but the tag is in the saved tags then it take as a tag.
Example:
savedTags = ["apple","mango","grapes"]
userText = "I have to buy #mango and apple"
output = ["apple","mango"]
